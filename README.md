# Doctor Alert System

A **Patient Voice-to-Text and Risk Alert System** using synthetic audio, transcription, BioBERT-based risk profiling, and automated email alerts. This system transcribes patient voice inputs, evaluates medical risk, stores data in a database, and notifies doctors when medium or high-risk conditions are detected.

## Project Overview

**Objective:**  
Convert patient speech into text, analyze medical risk levels, and alert doctors automatically for critical cases.

**Key Features:**
- Synthetic patient audio generation using gTTS.
- Audio preprocessing and transcription with OpenAI Whisper.
- Hybrid risk profiling using:
  - Keyword-based detection (high & medium risk terms)
  - Fine-tuned BioBERT classifier
- Automated email alerts for Medium/High-risk patients.
- Database storage (SQLite) of transcripts, risk profiling, and alerts.
- Evaluation metrics: WER, Precision, Recall, F1-score, alert reliability, and latency.

## Architecture & Technology Stack

**Frontend / Input:**  
- Text/voice input (synthetic or recorded patient audio)

**Processing Pipeline:**  
1. Audio preprocessing (Pydub)
2. Transcription (OpenAI Whisper)
3. Risk profiling (keywords + fine-tuned BioBERT)
4. Alert system (Gmail SMTP)

**Database & Storage:**  
- SQLite (`doctor_alert.db`) storing transcripts and alerts.

**Libraries & Frameworks:**  
- Python 3.10+  
- gTTS, Pydub, Whisper, Transformers, Torch, scikit-learn, pandas, fuzzywuzzy, jiwer

## Installation & Setup

1. **Download the repository** as ZIP from GitHub.  
2. **Upload the files to Google Colab**:  
   - Go to [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) → File → Upload Notebook  
   - Upload `Doctor_Alert_System.ipynb`
   - Go to Drive of the mail that you used for Google Colab, create `DASYSTEM` folder and upload `risk.csv`.

3. **Run the notebook:**
   - Run the Doctor Alert System.ipynb in Google Colab.
   - Follow the notebook cells step by step.
  
4. **Directory Structure:**
   When you run the code, the following folders and files will be automatically created:  

   - The main Colab notebook with all code.  
   - **`synthetic_audio_gtts/`** – Generated synthetic patient audio files (MP3).  
   - **`synthetic_audio_processed/`** – Preprocessed audio files (WAV, 16kHz, mono).  
   - **`transcript large/`** – Transcriptions of audio generated by Whisper.  
   - **`profile_results_biobert_patient_large/`** – JSON files with predicted risk levels.  
   - **`doctor_alert.db`** – SQLite database storing transcripts and alert information.  
   - **`patient_report.csv`** – Combined report of transcripts and risk alerts.  
   - **`risk.csv`** – Training dataset used for BioBERT risk classification. 
     - This file is included in the repository because the model is trained inside the notebook. 
     - The trained model is not uploaded (due to size limits), but users can retrain it by running the notebook.
  > **Note:** These files are **not included** in the repository. Running the notebook will generate them automatically.

5. **Notes for running the project:**
   - You don’t need to upload large files (like audio or database) to GitHub. Users can generate them by running the notebook.
   - If someone wants to reproduce results, they should just run the notebook step by step.
